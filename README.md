# Giant Hogweed Segmentation with TensorFlow
Welcome to our Giant Hogweed Segmentation project repository. This project is part of our Datalab IV course and aims to accurately segment the Giant Hogweed using various deep learning models implemented in TensorFlow.

### Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop and compare multiple deep learning models to determine the most effective approach for segmenting the Giant Hogweed.

### Models Implemented

We have implemented and compared the following five models:

- U-Net
- DeepLab
- Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
- Deep Layer Cascade
- ResNet-50
