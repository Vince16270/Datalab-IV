# Datalab IV
This repository contains the code and resources for segmenting the Giant Hogweed using TensorFlow in Python. This project is part of our Datalab IV course.

The goal of this project is to accurately segment the Giant Hogweed using various deep learning models. We will be implementing and comparing five different models to determine the most effective approach. The models used in this project are:

	1.	U-Net
	2.	DeepLab
	3.	Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
	4.	Deep Layer Cascade
    5. ResNet-50
